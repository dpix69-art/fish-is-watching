        "We work with this memory as a resonant body. Microphones are placed close to objects and corners, contact mics follow surfaces, and small speakers move sound through the rooms. We listen to how air, wood, and instruments react to each other and let the space decide when the piece begins and ends."

We treat the room as a moving instrument: sound travels between corners, between bodies, and between the different working areas of the house.",
        "Movement and sound are developed together. Performers shift their position in relation to speakers, microphones, and the audience. Small changes in distance open or close parts of the room, revealing new resonances and cancelling others. The piece invites quiet attention: instead of following a fixed dramaturgy, we stay with the slow changes of the space itself."
